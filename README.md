# TomatoRunner
Just my way of backing up my game files and scripts so I don't lose em

I've never finished a game, and I want one under my belt,
I would also like to make bigger projects, I have some ideas I am just not prepared for skill wise and to build on that, I've decided to make a "simple" one hit 2D platformer game.

You play as Kevin the Tomato and you have one life to get through each level, saving your friends as they've all been turned to vegetables by an evil witch >:( NOOOOOO!

I'm not taking this game too seriously, it's just to improve my C# coding and get my in the gist of working with Unity and posting games.

Thanks for reading and if you play whenever it's released, I hope you enjoy it.
